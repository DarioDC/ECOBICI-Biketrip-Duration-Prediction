# ECOBICI-Biketrip-Duration-Prediction

This project aims to analyze a public data base from Mexico City's public bike sharing system (ECOBICI), obtained from the official website (available both in Spanish and English), in order to predict bike duration from bike usage information and station locations.

As described on the website, ECOBICI started operating in February 2010 with 84 bike stations and 1,200 bikes. In only 6 years the system has grown 400% due to users demand. There are currently 480 bike stations, more than 6,000 bikes and more than 100,000 users benefit from this service from Monday to Sunday inside a 35 km2 area.

The public bike sharing system ECOBICI has been adopted as an efficient transportation alternative to move around Mexico City, not only because it complements the massive transportation network, but also because of the health, environmental, and time-saving benefits that contribute to a better quality of life.
